## üìã Development Requirements

### Prerequisites

- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) - Modern package management
- Git for version control
- Python 3.9+ (managed by pixi)

### Required Tools (Installed by pixi)

- **pytest**: Testing framework
- **mypy**: Static type checking
- **ruff**: Code formatting and linting
- **bandit**: Security analysis
- **pre-commit**: Git hooks for quality assurance
- **coverage**: Test coverage analysis

## üèóÔ∏è Development Setup

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pyrattler-recipe-autogen.git
cd pyrattler-recipe-autogen

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/millsks/pyrattler-recipe-autogen.git

# Install dependencies (includes editable install)
pixi install

# Setup development environment
pixi run dev-setup
```

### Development Environment

The project uses pixi for all development tasks:

```bash
# Format code
pixi run format

# Run linting
pixi run lint

# Run type checking
pixi run type-check

# Run security checks
pixi run security-check

# Run all quality checks (lint + type-check)
pixi run check

# Run all quality checks including security (lint + type-check + security-check)
pixi run check-all

# Run tests
pixi run test

# Run tests with coverage
pixi run test-cov

# Run full CI pipeline
pixi run ci
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Location**: Place tests in `tests/` directory
- **Naming**: Test files should start with `test_`
- **Coverage**: Aim for >95% test coverage
- **Types**: Include unit tests, integration tests, and edge cases

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description explaining what is being tested."""
    # Arrange - Set up test data
    input_data = {...}
    expected_result = {...}

    # Act - Call the function being tested
    result = function_under_test(input_data)

    # Assert - Verify the result
    assert result == expected_result
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pixi run test

# Run specific test file
pixi run python -m pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run specific test function
pixi run python -m pytest tests/test_core.py::test_function_name

# Run with coverage
pixi run test-cov

# Run with verbose output
pixi run python -m pytest -xvs
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Code Formatting

We use **ruff** for code formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format code automatically
pixi run format

# Check for linting issues
pixi run lint
```

### Type Annotations

- **Required**: All functions must have type annotations
- **Imports**: Use `from __future__ import annotations` for modern syntax
- **Complex Types**: Use `typing` module for complex types
- **Return Types**: Always specify return types, use `None` for procedures

Example:

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def process_data(data: dict[str, Any], options: list[str]) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """Process data with given options."""
    # Implementation
    return success, message
```

### Docstring Standards

Use Google-style docstrings:

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """Brief description of the function.

    Longer description if needed, explaining the function's purpose,
    behavior, and any important details.

    Args:
        param1: Description of the first parameter.
        param2: Description of the second parameter.

    Returns:
        Description of what the function returns.

    Raises:
        ValueError: Description of when this exception is raised.
        TypeError: Description of when this exception is raised.

    Example:
        >>> result = function_name("hello", 42)
        >>> print(result)
        True
    """
    # Implementation
```

## üîÑ Git Workflow

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names with prefixes:

- `feat/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

Examples:

- `feat/integration-enhancements`
- `fix/dependency-mapping-bug`
- `docs/readme-improvements`

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add pixi integration detection"
git commit -m "fix: resolve dependency mapping for numpy"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
git commit -m "test: add integration tests for CI/CD detection"
```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes**:

   - Write code
   - Add tests
   - Update documentation
   - Ensure all quality checks pass

4. **Quality Checks**:

   ```bash
   pixi run ci  # Runs format + check + test-cov
   ```

5. **Commit Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

6. **Push Branch**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feat/your-feature-name
